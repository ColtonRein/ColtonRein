âœ¨ I'm a frontend engineer and HTML email developer based out of Kansas City, KS. I'm passionate about making the web accessible to everyone and perfecting my email development skills.

I love reading about the newest front end development trends, and I do that through content on dev.to, slack channels like HTML geeks, and new Youtube videos. When I'm not coding, you can find me geeking about video games, participating in different discord communities, or imporving on my graphic design skills.
